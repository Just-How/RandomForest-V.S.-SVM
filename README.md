# RandomForest-V.S.-SVM

Given the dataset Letter Recognition dataset in - https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/59/letter+recognition

The first column of the dataset is the response variable. First choose two letters for this binary classification problem. We then write a Random Forest and a SVM classifier, tuning the parameters and choosing the best parameters for both models. Using the first 80% data for training and the remaining 20% for testing.

We then compare the two models with performance and run time. Also provide pros and cons for these two models and the results + accuracy.
